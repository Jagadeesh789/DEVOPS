# LINUX

**Types of user accounts in Linux**
  
  - Root user - (root user has all permissions)
  - Sudo user -(sudo user will have some of the root permissions but not all)
  - Non sudo user - (will have minimal permissions)

**Commands**
  
  - **Sudo -i**                           ---> to log in to root user
  - **Sudo -su username**                 ---> to log in to sudo user
  - **Su username**                       ---> to switch between the users (non sudo users) (root or sudo user can use this command)
 
**Note:**
  
  1. sudo user is not equal to root user.
  2. normal users cannot login to other user accounts.
